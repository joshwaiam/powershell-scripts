# powershell-scripts
A collection of helpful Powershell scripts I've come across and had to use at one time or another

## Getting Started
In order to run these scripts from the terminal, you will need to run the following command to trust Powershell scripts originating on your machine:

`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`

## TODO
- Add main script file with Switch statement to run scripts automatically, like a batch file
